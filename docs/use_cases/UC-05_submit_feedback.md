## Postconditions

### Success Postconditions

- New FeedbackResponse with FeedbackAnswers saved
- Submission cookie set in the browser
- Thank-you page is displayed

### Failure Postconditions

- Error message is displayed

## Business Rules

### BR-007: Rating Scale

Ratings are 1-5 (Very poor to Very good)

### BR-008: Optional Text Answers

Text answers are optional (only non-empty ones are saved)

### BR-009: New Response Per Submission

Each submission creates a new FeedbackResponse. Duplicate submissions are prevented via cookies (BR-011).

### BR-010: No Authentication

No authentication required for submitting feedback

### BR-011: Duplicate Submission Prevention

After submitting feedback, a browser cookie (`feedback_submitted_{formId}`) is set. On subsequent visits to the same form, the system detects the cookie and shows an "already submitted" message. This is a soft prevention mechanism — clearing cookies allows resubmission.
